# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## Research & Learning
* **How a Kanban Board Works:** A Kanban board visually maps out the workflow. It allows the team to see the exact status of every task at a glance, ensuring transparency without the need for constant status meetings.

* **Board Columns:** * *Not Started / Backlog:* Tasks waiting to be picked up.
    * *In Progress:* Tasks currently being worked on.
    * *Ready for Review / QA:* Development is done; the task is waiting for my testing.
    * *Approved by Bot / Done:* Testing passed, and the task is completed.
* **Task Movement:** Tasks are "pulled" from left to right. The person actively working on the task is responsible for moving the card and updating its status with clear, written comments.
* **Benefits of WIP Limits:** Limiting Work in Progress (WIP) prevents context switching and burnout. It ensures we finish current tasks before starting new ones, maintaining a steady, manageable flow.

## Reflection
* **Managing Priorities:** Kanban helps manage priorities by clearly ordering the "Not Started" column. As a QA, I don't get overwhelmed; I simply pull the top priority ticket from the "Ready for QA" column when I have the capacity, giving me the flexibility and focus I need.
* **Improving Workflow:** I can improve my workflow by strictly adhering to the WIP limit—focusing deeply on testing one feature at a time in my quiet workspace, rather than juggling multiple incomplete tests.

## Task Implementation
* **Kanban Board Creation:** I have set up the project Kanban board on GitHub with the columns: `Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Ready for Review`, and `Done`.
* **Moving a Task:** I successfully moved this very task (Issue #11) from `In Progress` to `Ready for Review`.
* **Task Tracking Improvement:** Before I move a ticket to "Done," I will ensure I leave a detailed, written QA comment directly on the ticket. This
