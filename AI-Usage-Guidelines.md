# AI Usage Guidelines - Xinran (Rita) Tian

## 🔍 Research & Learn
* **Tools for QA:** ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot are excellent for generating test cases, refactoring scripts, and explaining complex code.
* **Benefits & Risks:** AI increases coding speed and helps brainstorm edge cases. However, it can produce "hallucinations" (incorrect code) and poses security risks if sensitive data is shared.
* **Never-enter Info:** Internal source code, API keys, passwords, and sensitive company/customer data must **never** be entered into public AI tools.
* **Validation:** I will always manually run and debug any AI-generated code and cross-reference documentation to ensure accuracy.

## 📝 Reflection
* **When to use:** Use AI for brainstorming, boilerplate code generation, and learning new syntax.
* **Own skills:** Rely on my own logic for high-level test strategy and complex debugging that requires context AI doesn't have.
* **Data Privacy:** I will use generic/dummy data in AI prompts instead of real company data.

## 🛠️ Task & Best Practice
* **Task Improvement:** I used AI to help me structure my `internship_time_plan.md`. It saved me time on formatting.
* **Critical Review:** The AI suggested a specific format that I had to manually adjust to match the requirements.
* **My Best Practice:** "Always treat AI output as a draft that requires a human-in-the-loop review before implementation."
