# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

## Research & Learning
* **Main Agile Ceremonies:**
    * **Daily Stand-ups:** A brief daily sync to discuss what was done, what will be done, and any blockers.
    * **Sprint Planning vs. Continuous Prioritization:** Scrum plans work in 2-week batches; Kanban continuously refines the top of the backlog, allowing for high flexibility.
    * **Retrospectives:** A meeting at the end of a cycle to discuss what went well and what can be improved.
    * **Backlog Refinement:** Reviewing upcoming tickets to ensure they have clear, detailed instructions and acceptance criteria.
* **Asynchronous Collaboration:** Across time zones, Agile teams rely heavily on written updates in tools like Discord or Slack, detailed GitHub Issue descriptions, and recorded loom videos instead of live video calls.

## Reflection
* **Communication & Alignment:** Ceremonies keep the team aligned on overarching goals, but they don't always have to be live meetings. Written, asynchronous stand-ups are highly effective for keeping a clear record of blockers.
* **Most Important Ceremony for QA:** **Backlog Refinement**. For me to do my best testing, I need clear, detailed, and direct instructions on what the feature is supposed to do. Refining the backlog ensures that by the time a ticket reaches QA, all ambiguity has been resolved.

## Task Implementation
* **Stand-up Observation:** I participated in an asynchronous team stand-up via written messages. This format is incredibly efficient as it allows everyone time to process the updates without the interruption of a long video call.
* **Retrospective Participation:** I reviewed the notes from our recent retrospective, focusing on action items related to QA handoffs.
* **Collaboration Improvement:** I will advocate for **Asynchronous Written Stand-ups** and request that developers ping me with direct, written instructions on Discord when a ticket is moved to "Ready for QA." This reduces my reliance on verbal feedback, which can easily be forgotten, and ensures I have a clear reference point.
