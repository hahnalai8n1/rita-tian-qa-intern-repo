# Professionalism at Focus Bear

## Research & Learning
* **Professional vs. Unprofessional:** Professional behavior involves being self-led, taking initiative, and sharing valuable ideas. Unprofessional behavior includes waiting around for instructions, ghosting the project, or asking basic questions that could be answered with a 10-second internet search.
* **Respectful Communication:** Respectful communication means coming prepared to meetings with an agenda, taking careful notes, and avoiding multitasking. It also means keeping things efficient; skipping small talk to get straight to the point is welcomed.
* **Handling Feedback & Direction:** If the direction is unclear, it is best to propose a solution by saying, "Based on my research, I think I should do X next. Is that what you'd recommend?". It is also crucial to take action on feedback so the same issues are not repeated in future reviews.

## Reflection
* **Great Teamwork:** Effective teamwork relies on clear, documented expectations. Sending calendar invites that include the specific project name and a clear agenda ensures everyone is aligned before a discussion even begins. 
* **Clear & Inclusive Communication:** I will ensure my communication is clear by providing daily written updates at the end of my workday. This async habit keeps the team in sync and eliminates the need for supervisors to chase me for progress reports.
* **Meeting Preparation:** Before any synchronous meeting, I will thoroughly review the project brief, test the app, and prepare a written list of questions. During the meeting, I will take detailed notes—or use an AI note-taker—to ensure I have clear written instructions to refer back to later.
* **Proactivity as an Intern:** Being proactive means trying to unblock myself first. If I encounter a QA issue, I will search online, ask ChatGPT, or message a teammate. If I am still stuck after 30 minutes, I will reach out to my supervisor with the context of what I have already tried.
* **Follow-ups & Escalation:** I will match my communication medium to the urgency of the issue:
    * **Email:** General approvals (expecting a 48-hour reply).
    * **Discord/Teams:** Medium-priority blockers needing a 24-hour response.
    * **SMS:** Urgent issues requiring a 2-hour response.
    * **Call:** True emergencies, such as being completely locked out of systems.
    If a message is missed, I will proactively send a polite written nudge.
* **Things I Won't Do:** I will not wing it in meetings, ignore action items, rely on slow communication channels for urgent fires, or send vague calendar invites like "Client meeting".

## Task Implementation
* **Emergency Contact:** I have securely saved the Jeremy's phone number from the onboarding deck for major escalations.
