# Cyber Security at Focus Bear

## Research & Learning
* **Common Threats:** In a remote environment, the biggest threats are phishing emails, malicious links, and "Man-in-the-Middle" attacks when using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.
* **Best Practices:** Always use an encrypted connection (VPN) in public spaces. Keep software updated, and use strong, unique passwords across all platforms.
* **Locking the Computer:** Leaving a device unlocked, even for a minute to grab a coffee, exposes sensitive company and user data to anyone walking by. It is a critical physical security vulnerability.
* **Handling Suspicious Links:** Never click on urgent or unexpected links, even if they appear to come from a colleague. Always verify through a secondary, written communication channel (e.g., sending a direct Slack message to ask, "Did you just send me this?").
* **Strong Passwords & Managers:** A strong password is long, complex, and unique. A password manager is essential because it generates and remembers these complex passwords, meaning I only need to remember one master password.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** 2FA adds a second layer of security (like a code sent to a phone) beyond just the password. It should be enabled on all accounts, especially email, GitHub, and internal testing tools.



## Reflection
* **Current Measures & Improvements:** I currently use strong passwords, but I can improve by strictly avoiding public Wi-Fi without a VPN. Working in cafe environments means I must be exceptionally vigilant about shoulder surfing (people looking at my screen).
* **Building Secure Habits:** I will make screen-locking an automatic muscle memory action. Every time I stand up from my chair, my hand will execute the lock screen keyboard shortcut (`Win + L` or `Cmd + Ctrl + Q`).
* **Securing Accounts:** I will audit my QA testing accounts to ensure none are sharing identical passwords.
* **Breach Protocol:** If I suspect a breach, I will immediately disconnect from the network, lock the device, and send an urgent, direct written report to the IT/Security lead detailing exactly what occurred.

## Task Implementation
* **Account Security:** I have enabled 2FA on my GitHub and Focus Bear work accounts.
* **Password Storage:** I have installed a secure password manager and migrated my work credentials into it.
* **Auto-Lock:** I have configured my laptop to automatically require a password after 3 minutes of inactivity.
* **New Cyber Security Habit:** I am implementing the "Never Plain Text" rule. I will never send API keys, passwords, or raw user data in direct messages or GitHub issues.
