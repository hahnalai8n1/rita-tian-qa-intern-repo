# Roles in an Agile Team

## Research & Learning
* **Key Roles in an Agile Team:**
    * **Developers:** Write the code, build new features, and fix bugs.
    * **QA (Quality Assurance):** Test the product, identify bugs, and ensure the software meets quality standards before release.
    * **Product Manager (PM):** Defines the product vision, prioritizes the backlog, and represents the user's needs.
    * **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM) / Scrum Master:** Facilitates the Agile process, removes blockers, and helps the team improve their workflow.
    * **Supporting Roles (UX, Support):** UX designs the interface; Support handles live user issues and feeds them back to the PM/QA.
* **Collaboration (Kanban vs. Scrum):** * In **Scrum**, roles collaborate through frequent, structured synchronous meetings (daily stand-ups, sprint planning). 
    * In **Kanban**, collaboration is more continuous and heavily relies on the visual board. Handoffs (e.g., from Developer to QA) happen fluidly as tickets move across the board, often prioritizing asynchronous communication on the tickets themselves.

## Reflection
* **My Role (QA):** As a QA Intern, I act as the quality gatekeeper. I ensure that new features work as intended and don't break existing functionality. My role brings stability to the Agile process by catching issues before they reach the user.
* **Interactions with Other Roles:** I work directly downstream from the Developers. Once they finish coding a feature, it moves to my column for testing. I also interact closely with the Product Manager to ensure I fully understand the specific acceptance criteria and detailed requirements of a task.

## Task Implementation
* **Role Description:** I test software updates, document bugs with high attention to detail, and verify that fixes resolve the root problem. I rely on clear, detailed written instructions in task tickets to execute my testing effectively.
* **Improving Teamwork with Developers:** The role I collaborate with most frequently is the Developer. To improve our teamwork, I will prioritize writing highly detailed, structured, and direct bug reports directly in our project management tool. By providing clear written feedback with exact steps to reproduce an issue, we can minimize the need for long, synchronous video calls or unstructured discussions. This ensures the feedback isn't forgotten and gives both the developer and myself the necessary time to process complex issues independently.
