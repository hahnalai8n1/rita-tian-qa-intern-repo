# Git Knowledge & Setup

## Reflection

**Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?**
I have used Git for managing personal projects and basic version control, primarily focusing on simple commits and pushes rather than complex team workflows.

**Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?**
I chose to use the built-in Git GUI in **VS Code** (alongside GitHub Desktop). I prefer having a clear, visual representation of my file changes (diffs). Reviewing exact line-by-line changes visually before committing ensures that my detailed written updates are accurate and free of unintended modifications.

**What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?**
The clear distinction between the "Working Directory," the "Staging Area," and the "Repository." Understanding that staging acts as a precise drafting area allows me to meticulously review and group related changes together before finalizing them into a commit. This structured approach perfectly supports a methodical QA workflow.
