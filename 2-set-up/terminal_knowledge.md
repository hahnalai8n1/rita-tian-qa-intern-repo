 # Terminal Setup & Knowledge

## Reflection

**Which terminal client did you choose? Why?**
I chose **Windows Terminal** (or **iTerm2** if on Mac). It supports multi-tab and split-pane views. Having the ability to run a local server in one pane while running test scripts in another provides the structured, uncluttered workspace I need to monitor processes clearly without toggling between multiple windows.

**What customizations (if any) did you make?**
I configured a dark mode theme with high-contrast text. This reduces eye strain during long periods of reading through terminal logs and test outputs. I also customized the starting directory so the terminal automatically opens in my primary workspace folder.

**What was the most useful command you learned today?**
The `grep` (Mac/Linux) / `Select-String` (Windows PowerShell) command. The ability to instantly search through massive text logs for specific error keywords or specific written text strings is an incredibly powerful tool for isolating bugs efficiently.
