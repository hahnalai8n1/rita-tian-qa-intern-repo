## Top 10 Useful Keyboard Shortcuts

### Navigation
1. **Quick Open / Go to File:** `Ctrl+P` (Windows) / `Cmd+P` (Mac) - Quickly jump to any file without using the mouse.
2. **Global Search:** `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+F` (Mac) - Search for specific text or bug references across the entire project.
3. **Toggle Sidebar:** `Ctrl+B` (Windows) / `Cmd+B` (Mac) - Hides the file explorer to maximize screen space for deep focus.

### Editing
4. **Multiple Cursors (Add cursor below):** `Ctrl+Alt+Down` (Windows) / `Cmd+Option+Down` (Mac) - Edit multiple lines simultaneously. Highly efficient for formatting test data.

5. **Add Cursor at Click:** `Alt+Click` (Windows) / `Option+Click` (Mac) - Place cursors exactly where needed for targeted multi-line edits.
6. **Copy Line Up/Down:** `Shift+Alt+Down/Up` (Windows) / `Shift+Option+Down/Up` (Mac) - Quickly duplicate lines of code or test cases.

### Debugging
7. **Toggle Breakpoint:** `F9` - Set a pause point in the code to inspect variables during QA testing.
8. **Step Over:** `F10` - Move to the next line of code while debugging without diving into functions.

### Terminal Commands
9. **Toggle Integrated Terminal:** `Ctrl+\`` (Windows/Mac) - Open or hide the terminal without leaving the editor.
10. **New Terminal Instance:** `Ctrl+Shift+\`` (Windows/Mac) - Open a fresh terminal tab to run multiple processes concurrently.

## Reflection

**Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?**
The multiple cursors feature and the Global Search (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) will be the most useful. When reviewing logs or setting up detailed QA test cases, being able to edit multiple data points at once ensures consistency and saves significant time. Global search allows me to trace exact error messages directly to the source code.

**How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?**
Keyboard shortcuts keep my hands on the keyboard, preventing the constant context-switching of reaching for the mouse. This helps me maintain a state of deep focus and process information much faster when executing detailed, step-by-step test plans.
