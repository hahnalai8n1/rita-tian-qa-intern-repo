# Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions

## Reflection

**Which extensions did you install? Why?**
I installed **React Developer Tools**, **Redux DevTools**, a **JSON Viewer**, and **Lighthouse**. 
As a QA Intern, these tools empower me to investigate issues asynchronously. Instead of immediately scheduling a meeting with a developer when an error occurs, I can use these extensions to inspect the component state or network data independently. This allows me to provide clear, detailed, and highly specific written bug reports.


**What was the most useful thing you learned?**
The **JSON Viewer** extension is immediately impactful. Raw API responses are typically dense blocks of unformatted text. The viewer automatically structures this data into a clean, readable, color-coded hierarchy. Having information presented in this clear, direct format drastically reduces the time it takes to verify data payloads during testing.
