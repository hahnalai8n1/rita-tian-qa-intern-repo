# AI Tools for Development

## Research & Experimentation

**Which AI tools did you try?**
I experimented with **ChatGPT** (for general debugging and concept explanation) and **GitHub Copilot** (for inline code suggestions within VS Code).

**What worked well? What didn’t?**
* **Worked well:** Asking ChatGPT to explain complex coding concepts in simple, structured text. As someone who needs time to process new information, having a detailed, written explanation that I can read at my own pace is much more effective than asking a developer during a synchronous video call. It is also excellent for generating structured QA test data (like dummy JSON files).
* **Didn't work well:** Sometimes AI hallucinates specific details about proprietary codebases. You cannot blindly trust the code it generates; it always requires manual QA testing and verification.

**When do you think AI is most useful for coding?**
AI is incredibly useful as an asynchronous mentor. When I am stuck on a testing script or terminal command, I can get immediate, clear written feedback without interrupting my team's workflow. It is also highly effective for automating the repetitive parts of writing test cases, allowing me to focus my energy on the actual logic and edge cases.
