# Reflection: Agile Principles & Frameworks

## Research & Learning
* **Agile vs. Traditional:** Traditional project management (like Waterfall) is strictly sequential, where testing only happens at the very end. Agile is iterative and flexible, breaking work down into smaller, manageable chunks with continuous feedback loops.
* **Core Values:** The Agile Manifesto prioritizes:
    1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
    2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
    3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
    4. Responding to change over following a plan.
* **Scrum vs. Kanban:** * **Scrum** works in fixed timeboxes (Sprints, usually 2 weeks) with specific roles (Scrum Master) and mandatory recurring meetings (daily stand-ups, sprint planning).
    * **Kanban** is a continuous flow system focused on visualizing work and limiting "Work in Progress" (WIP). Tasks are pulled from a backlog as capacity allows.
* **Why Focus Bear leans towards Kanban:** Kanban offers higher flexibility. It avoids the overhead of lengthy planning meetings and rigid sprint cycles, allowing the team to continuously deliver updates and adapt to new priorities instantly.



## Reflection
* **Benefits & Challenges:** * *Benefit:* High flexibility and continuous improvement. Visualizing work on a Kanban board provides clear, written context for what needs to be done without relying on verbal updates.
    * *Challenge:* Without clear, detailed written instructions on each ticket, Agile can become chaotic. It requires strong asynchronous communication discipline.
* **Improving My Role:** As a QA Intern, Agile allows me to test small, specific features as soon as they are ready. This gives me the necessary time to process ideas and thoroughly document clear, direct written feedback on bugs, rather than being overwhelmed by a massive release at the end of a project.

## Task Implementation
* **Summary of Scrum vs. Kanban:** Scrum is structured and time-boxed with frequent required meetings, while Kanban is fluid, highly flexible, and focused on continuous delivery by limiting how many tasks are actively being worked on at once.
* **Most Useful Agile Principle:** *"Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."* This principle is incredibly useful for my work style. It supports having the flexibility to work in environments where I focus best (like a cafe) and relying on clear, written ticket details rather than constant synchronous check-ins.
