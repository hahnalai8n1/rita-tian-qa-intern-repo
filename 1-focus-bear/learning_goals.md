# Reflection: Learning Goals & Contributions

## 1. What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I hope to gain hands-on experience in testing complex desktop applications and successfully integrating QA processes into a live Agile workflow. I specifically want to master automated End-to-End (E2E) testing using tools like Pywinauto.

## 2. What skills are you most excited to develop?
I am highly motivated to develop my skills in writing robust, maintainable automated test scripts and structuring E2E tests so they are stable and reliable within the CI/CD pipeline.

## 3. What do you think you can contribute to the team?
My core strength is my attention to detail and my preference for clear, direct, and highly detailed written communication. I will contribute by providing exceptional, thorough bug reports. By documenting issues so clearly in writing, I can help developers understand and fix problems asynchronously, minimizing the need for disruptive synchronous meetings. 

## 4. What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I currently feel less confident in handling "flaky" automated tests and troubleshooting complex test failures in a CI/CD environment. I am eager to use the time and space I need to process these complex technical challenges and improve my debugging skills.

## 5. What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success looks like being able to independently write, run, and maintain E2E tests, while successfully managing my QA tasks on the Kanban board with minimal friction and highly effective written documentation.
