# Research Assignment: Competitive Landscape

## 1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
* **Freedom & Cold Turkey:** These are primarily strict website/app blockers. They are excellent at stopping distractions but do little to build positive habits.
* **Tiimo & Routinery:** These are fantastic visual routine planners designed for neurodivergence, but they lack the aggressive, system-level blocking capabilities.
* **Focus Bear's Difference:** Focus Bear uniquely combines the "carrot" and the "stick." It provides the system-level blocking of Cold Turkey but pairs it with the neurodivergent-friendly routine guidance of Routinery (e.g., forcing a user to complete a morning stretching routine before the computer unlocks).

## 2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
I would choose Focus Bear because it removes the burden of choice. With other apps, I still have to decide to open the app and start a timer. Focus Bear's system-wide integration forces the routine to happen automatically, which is crucial for overcoming executive dysfunction.

## 3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
Tiimo has an incredibly strong integration with wearables (like the Apple Watch), providing color-coded, haptic feedback on the wrist to help users visualize time passing without needing to look at a screen.

## 4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
Focus Bear could improve its visual UI to be slightly more intuitive or "gamified" during the routine execution phases. Sometimes, highly strict blockers can feel punishing rather than supportive; adding more positive visual reinforcement upon completing a routine could enhance the user experience for those with low frustration tolerance.
