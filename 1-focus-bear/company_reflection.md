# Focus Bear: Company Reflection

## 1. Understanding Focus Bear’s Mission & Vision

**Why do you think Focus Bear was created?**
Focus Bear was created to bridge the gap in productivity tools for neurodivergent individuals (such as those with ADHD or Autism) and anyone who struggles with executive dysfunction. Traditional productivity apps often act as passive to-do lists, but Focus Bear was built to provide active, structured interventions that guide users through routines and block distractions.

**What problem is Focus Bear solving?**
It solves the modern challenges of digital distraction, hyperfocus, and the difficulty of initiating tasks. For many, simply knowing what to do isn't enough; the internet is full of rabbit holes. Focus Bear acts as a strict but supportive barrier against these distractions while also solving the physical strain problem by enforcing movement breaks.

**Why do you think this mission is important?**
This mission is vital because the modern digital workspace is inherently noisy and distracting. Leveling the playing field for neurodivergent individuals—and helping everyone maintain their well-being and productivity—creates a much more inclusive and healthier working world.

**How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?**
I highly value having a quiet, structured environment to do my best work. Just as I seek out the right ambient environment (like a quiet café) to concentrate, Focus Bear creates a focused digital environment. I appreciate clear, detailed structures, and Focus Bear’s customizable routines align perfectly with how I prefer to organize my day.

**Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?**
Yes. When I am deeply involved in QA testing or processing complex ideas, I can easily lose track of time and forget to take screen breaks or stretch. I also find constant notifications or "noisy" digital environments very disruptive to my workflow, which makes Focus Bear's distraction-blocking features incredibly relatable and useful.
