# Reflection: Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

## Research & Learning
* **Risks of Laptop-Only Use:** Using a laptop without external peripherals often leads to "hunched" posture (kyphosis), neck strain (tech neck), and increased risk of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome due to the fixed keyboard angle.
* **Ergonomic Equipment:** Key improvements include:
    * **Laptop Stand:** Raises the screen to eye level to prevent neck bending.
    * **External Keyboard & Mouse:** Allows elbows to stay at a 90-degree angle while the screen is elevated.
    * **Lumbar Support:** Essential for maintaining the natural curve of the spine.
* **Ideal Adjustments:** * The top third of the monitor should be at eye level.
    * Feet should be flat on the floor or on a footrest.
    * Shoulders should be relaxed, not hunched toward the ears.
* **Healthy Habits:** Following the **20-20-20 rule** (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds) to reduce eye strain, and taking standing/stretching breaks every hour.

## Reflection
* **Equipment Changes:** Since I move between a quiet home workspace and cafes, I will invest in a **portable laptop stand** and a **compact mechanical keyboard**. This allows me to maintain ergonomics even when I'm not at a fixed desk.
* **Behavioural Changes:** I need to stop leaning into the screen when I'm focusing deeply. I will practice sitting back in my chair and letting my eyes bring the information to me rather than moving my head toward the laptop.
* **Reminders:** I will utilize **Focus Bear’s built-in movement breaks**. Since I prefer structured, clear instructions, having the app tell me exactly when to stretch helps me stay disciplined without having to "remember" to do it manually.

## Task Implementation
* **Workspace Adjustment:** I have raised my laptop using a stand so that I am no longer looking down. This immediately reduced the tension in my upper back.
* **Equipment Identified:** A **vertical mouse** would be a great addition to my setup to prevent wrist pronation during long QA testing sessions.
* **Habit Adjustment:** I implemented a "posture check" every time I take a sip of water. Combined with Focus Bear's reminders, I noticed significantly less fatigue at the end of the workday.
